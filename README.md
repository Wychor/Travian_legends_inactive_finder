# Travian_legends_inactive_finder
## Description
This is an inactive finder for Travian Legends (https://www.travian.com/).
This has been done before and better tools exist.
HOWEVER, this tool is available to everyone not just to use, but to copy and make their own version of.
It now also has a unique feature (as far as I know) that allows you to load and filter out farms that are already in your farmlist.

## Legal stuff
I am going to keep the legal stuff simple.
1. This software offers no guarantees. You can't sue me if things go wrong.
2. If you copy this to make your own, credit me (Wicher Otten).
3. If you copy this to make your own and make yours commercial, you still can't sue me.

As for how this impacts your gameplay, not my concern. You can couple a bot to this stuff for all I care.

Disclaimer for Travian. If any of this violates any of your rules, guidelines, whatever, let me know and I'll change or delete this.

## Requirements
Python


## Usage
In its current state you need to adjust your settings in the files itself.
Next up... I don't know yet.
Perhaps I'll turn this into a web based thingy. We'll see.

Any suggestions, technical (performance and such) or features, are very much welcomed.
